-- This query calculates the percentage of constructors by nationality and orders them by total count.

SELECT Nationality,
	COUNT(nationality) AS TotalNumber,
	CAST(COUNT(Nationality) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(Nationality)) OVER () AS DECIMAL(5, 2)) AS Percentage 
FROM F1_Analysis.dbo.constructors AS Constructors 
	GROUP BY Nationality 
	ORDER BY TotalNumber DESC; 

/* This query analyses the distribution of constructors by nationality, highlighting which countries dominate Formula 1.
The findings show that 43.92% (488 constructors) of all constructors listed in the database are British, more than double the next highest nationality, Italian, 
whose constructors account for 18.36% (204 constructors), a 139.22% difference relative to the Italian count. This data would suggest that overall, the British 
dominate constructor positions in Formula 1. 

This dominance could be attributed to the UK's strong motorsport industry, which has historically housed major F1 teams and manufacturers.

To gain deeper insights, I propose narrowing the analysis to modern Formula 1 (year >= 2000). 
This approach will reveal whether the dominance of British constructors persists in the modern era or if the competitive landscape has shifted.*/
